NAME
----
mmda - a minimal mail delivery agent

SYNOPSIS
--------
mmda [deliver | forward] <username>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

mmda is a local delivery helper program for the mmta mail transfer agent.
It needs to store messages to the mailboxes and maildirs of the receiving
user and thus should be installed setuid root.

mmda reads an email message from standard input and delivers it to a
given local user honoring the users .forward file.
The addresses to which messages could not be delivered are printed to standard
output and should be taken care of by then higher level program, i.e. mmta.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------
deliver::
	Delivers mail to a local user honoring the contents of users
	.forward file. If the message is forwarded to an external host
	(i.e. .forward contains a line of type user@external.org), then
	the message is put into the mail queue of the user using the
	external 'queue-mail' command (or script) which is read from
	either local or global configuration directory.
	Local delivery is made to an mbox-style local mailbox
	to /var/mail/username. If this mailbox does not exist, it is created.

forward::
	Same as 'deliver', but an attempt at sending the mail queue of the
	receiving user is made immediately after delivery.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
0::
	Successful execution.

1::
	Wrong number of command line arguments given.

2::
	<username> is a privileged user (uid < 1000).

3::
	<username> is invalid.

4::
	Dropping of root privileges was not successful.
