ALIASES(5)
==========

NAME
----
aliases - aliases file for mmta

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This manual page describes the format of the aliases file, as used by
mmta(7). The aliases file can be used to forward mail sent to an alias
address to a local user, or a group of local users.

The aliases file is comprised of logical lines of the format

    key: value1, value2, ...

A logical line can be broken into more than one physical lines by
ending the physical line with the `\´ character.

    key: value1, \
    value2, ...

Lines starting with `#´ are considered to be comments and ignored.

Here `key´ is the name of the alias, which makes it also a valid local
mail address. During alias processing, the key is recursively expanded
to the values listed after the colon. A single value can be either a
local user name, or another alias definition.

Some Unix mail systems also support defining other types of alias
values, similar to the forward(5) mechanism.  These include appending to
files, piping to commands, using the `:include:´ alias to read alias
definitions from another file, forwarding to external email addresses,
returning error codes and delivering to maildirs. The mmta mail system
does not support these types of values, but does recognize them.  A
warning message is emitted when these unsupported alias definitions are
seen. See the aliases(5) manual page from the OpenSMTPD project
(https://www.opensmtpd.org/manual.html) for more details on these more
complex aliases files.

EXAMPLES
--------
Debian usually has an /etc/aliases file similar to following, after
installation:

    # /etc/aliases
    mailer-daemon: postmaster
    postmaster: root
    nobody: root
    hostmaster: root
    usenet: root
    news: root
    webmaster: root
    www: root
    ftp: root
    abuse: root
    noc: root
    security: root
    root: user

Here `user´ is the username of the mandatory user account configured during
installation. This aliases file forwards all mail to the system users to
root and finally mail to root is sent to the account `user´.
