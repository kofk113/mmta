NAME
----
mmda - a minimal mail delivery agent

SYNOPSIS
--------
mmda [--no-external] [--force-mbox] <username>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

mmda is a local delivery helper program for the mmta mail transfer agent.
It needs to store messages to the mailboxes and maildirs of the receiving
user and thus should be installed setuid root.

mmda reads an email message from standard input and delivers it to a given
local user with the targets given in the users .forward file (see forward(5)).
The addresses to which messages could not be delivered are printed to standard
output and should be taken care of by then higher level program, i.e. mmta.

OPTIONS
-------
--no-external::
    Delivery is made to local targets, but if .forward processing results
    in external mail addresses (e.g. recipient@host.com), this address
    is printed to standard output for processing by higher level tools.
    The default, when this option is not given, is to store the message
    to the outgoing mail-queue of <username>.

--force-mbox::
	Delivery is made as usual, but the message is also placed to the users
    default mailbox at /var/mail/username. If this mailbox does not exist,
    it is created.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
0::
	Successful execution.

3::
	`queue-mailÂ´ script failed

4::
	Could not deliver to a piped command in .forward.

5::
	Could not deliver to a filename given in .forward.

6::

7::

    .forward targets may have been delivered into.
