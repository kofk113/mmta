suid helper must do:
* cat mail to /var/mail/user
* cat ~/.forward file
* execute a given line (mail destination) from ./forward file
  when given mail in stdin (no comments allowed in .forward, 
  one destination per line)
* check if user can send mail with msmtp (run msmtp -P with user privs)
* place mails in users msmtp queue (mail queue in /var/mail/user.mailq,
  not in user homedir, this is to prevent overfilling quota)
* trigger a msmtp delivery attempt with user privileges
* Name of the program: mmda ("minimal mail delivery agent")
* Commands:
    mmda user mbox (or maildir)
    mmda user cat-forward
    mmda user run-forward lineno
    mmda user can-send
    mmda user queue-mail
    mmda user run-queue
* Maybe have a configuration file for 'can-send', 'queue-mail' and 'run-queue'
  commands
* Make cron script which runs every half-hour and for each user, runs 
  + 'mmda can-send' to check if user can send mail
  + If yes, runs 'mmda run-queue'

* New design with commands:
    mmda user : runs .forward and outputs local usernames which were found in 
        the .forward file. If user cannot send external mail (script 'can-send')        output also the external addresses
    mmda -s user : sends out the mails in users queue
