suid helper must do:
* cat mail to /var/mail/user
* cat ~/.forward file
* execute a given line (mail destination) from ./forward file
  when given mail in stdin (no comments allowed in .forward, 
  one destination per line)
* check if user can send mail with msmtp (run msmtp -P with user privs)
* place mails in users msmtp queue (mail queue in /var/mail/user.mailq,
  not in user homedir, this is to prevent overfilling quota)
* trigger a msmtp delivery attempt with user privileges
* Name of the program: mmda ("minimal mail delivery agent")
* Commands:
    mmda user mbox (or maildir)
    mmda user cat-forward
    mmda user run-forward lineno
    mmda user can-send
    mmda user queue-mail
    mmda user run-queue
* Maybe have a configuration file for 'can-send', 'queue-mail' and 'run-queue'
  commands
* Make cron script which runs every half-hour and for each user, runs 
  + 'mmda can-send' to check if user can send mail
  + If yes, runs 'mmda run-queue'

* New design with commands:
    mmda deliver user 
        Runs .forward and delivers mail to pipes, named files
        (mboxes) and to the users default mailbox if '(\)user' -line is 
        present. Other local and external mail addresses found in the 
        .forward file are output to stdout
    mmda forward user
        The same as deliver, but if user can send external mail, the external 
        mail forwards in .forward are placed in the outgoing mail queue of
        user. If user cannot send external mail, functions exactly like
        'mmda deliver', i.e. output the exteral mail addresses in .forward
    mmda flush user 
        Attempts to send out the mails in users outgoing mail queue.
