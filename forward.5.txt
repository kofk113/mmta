FORWARD(5)
==========

NAME
----
forward - email forwarding information file for mmda(8)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The .forward file in a users home directory contains a list of mail
addresses, mailbox files or programs to which the users mail should be
redirected to. If this file does not exist, mail will not be forwarded,
but is instead delivered to the users default mailbox at /var/mail/user.

Before processing, the type and permissions of the .forward file are
checked. The .forward file should be a regular file, owned by either the
user or root and should not be group or world writable. If these
conditions are not met, mail is delivered only to the users default
mailbox.

Each line in a .forward file is a separate delivery target.  Lines
starting with the `#´ character are considered to be comments and
ignored. The following types of targets are supported by mmda(8):

user::
    (Here `user´ means your username) Mail is delivered to the receiving
    users default mbox file at /var/mail/user. See below for handling of
    a backslash prefix.

local_address::
    Mail is forwarded to another local user, who may then forward it
    further using another .forward file.

address@otherhost::
    A line containing the `@´ character is interpreted as an external
    email address, and the mail is sent there.

/path/to/file::
    Mail is delivered to a given mbox-file. The mbox-file targets must
    begin with a forward slash `/´.

"|/path/to/program plus args"::
    A line starting with a pipe character `|´ is considered to be an
    executable program followed by optional arguments. The mail is
    piped to this program for processing. Traditionally the whole
    command, including the pipe character is enclosed with quotation
    marks, either single or double quotes. With mmda the quotes are
    optional.

Some mail delivery implementations give a special meaning to lines
prefixed by the backslash character `\´ and stop further processing of
the .forward file if a local address is prefixed by a backslash. The
mmda(8) mail delivery program filters out backslash characters and
proceeds to process the complete .forward file.

If the .forward file is being edited during attempted mail delivery, the
delivery might fail if the .forward file is not fully written.  It is
best to copy the .forward file to a temporary file, edit this file and
then rename the temporary file to .forward atomically using the mv(1)
command.

EXAMPLES
--------
For example, if a .forward  file contained the following lines:

    nobody@debian.org
    "|/usr/bin/vacation nobody"

Mail would  be forwarded to the external address <nobody@debian.org> and
piped as standard input to the program /usr/bin/vacation with the single
argument nobody.
